# Mistral OCR App

The **Mistral OCR App** is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages the [Mistral OCR API](https://docs.mistralai.com/) to extract text from both PDF documents and images. Users can either provide a URL or upload a local file. The app displays the original document (or image) in a preview alongside the extracted OCR results and offers a seamless download optionâ€”all without refreshing the page.

- **Original Filename Preservation:** Download files maintain the original document names.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- [Mistralai Python Client](https://pypi.org/project/mistralai/)
- [PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nimsalcade/MistralAI-OCR.git
   cd MistralAI-OCR
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):**

   On macOS/Linux:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Required Dependencies:**

   Create a `requirements.txt` file (if not already present) with:
   ```plaintext
   streamlit
   mistralai
   PyPDF2
   ```

   Then install them:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Your Mistral API Key:**

   The app requires a Mistral API key. Export your API key as an environment variable:

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

   - On Windows (Command Prompt):
     ```bash
     set MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```

## Usage

To run the app, use the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

### How It Works

1. **API Key Entry:**  
   When you launch the app, you'll be prompted to enter your Mistral API key.

2. **File Type & Source Selection:**  
   Choose whether you want to process a **PDF** or an **Image** and select the source typeâ€”either via a URL or by uploading a file.

3. **Advanced PDF Settings (for large documents):**  
   For PDFs, you can configure the chunk size for splitting large documents. This helps process PDFs with hundreds of pages.

4. **Processing:**  
   Click the **Process** button to send the document to the Mistral OCR API. The app then:
   - Displays a preview of the document in the left column.
   - Shows the extracted OCR results in the right column.
   - Provides download links for the OCR output in multiple formats.

5. **Download:**  
   Click the download link to save the OCR result as JSON, TXT, or MD file. Downloads preserve the original filename.
